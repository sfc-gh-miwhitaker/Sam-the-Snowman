**Author:** SE Community  
**Purpose:** Reference implementation for Snowflake Intelligence agent with query performance analysis  
**Created:** 2025-11-25 | **Expires:** 2025-12-25 (30 days) | **Status:** ACTIVE

---

⚠️ **NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE - EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION ONLY**

Sam-the-Snowman is a Snowflake Intelligence agent that inspects your account usage data and returns actionable guidance on query performance, cost control, and warehouse operations. Deploy the agent in a few minutes, ask natural-language questions, and receive answers backed by live telemetry from your environment.

👋 **First time here? Follow these steps:**
1. `QUICKSTART.md` - Copy/paste deployment guide (< 5 min)
2. Open [`deploy_all.sql`](https://github.com/sfc-gh-miwhitaker/Sam-the-Snowman/blob/main/deploy_all.sql) on GitHub
3. Copy entire script → Paste into Snowsight worksheet → Click "Run All"
4. Navigate to **AI & ML → Agents** → Select **Sam-the-Snowman**

**Total setup time: ~5 minutes**

**Expected cost to deploy:** ~0.10 credits of X-Small warehouse time (≈$0.20 on Snowflake Standard) plus <1 GB storage (<$0.05/mo).

**Version**: 4.0 · **License**: Apache 2.0

---

## What You Deploy

- **Performance diagnostics** – spotlight slow or error-prone queries and suggest fixes.
- **Cost insight** – track warehouse credit consumption and identify expensive workloads.
- **Warehouse sizing** – highlight queues, concurrency, and right-sizing opportunities.
- **Documentation lookup** – search official Snowflake guidance with Cortex Search.
- **Email delivery** – send HTML summaries to stakeholders directly from Snowflake.
- **Dedicated compute** – auto-created X-Small warehouse (`SFE_SAM_SNOWMAN_WH`) for every workload.

---

## Quick Start (Summary)

**Single-script deployment** – No Git workspace or file system navigation required:

1. **Copy** the [`deploy_all.sql`](https://github.com/sfc-gh-miwhitaker/Sam-the-Snowman/blob/main/deploy_all.sql) script from GitHub
2. **Open Snowsight** → Create new SQL worksheet
3. **Paste** the entire script
4. **Click "Run All"** (▶▶) or press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter
5. **Wait ~3-5 minutes** for automated deployment
6. **Navigate to AI & ML → Agents** → Select `Sam-the-Snowman`

The script automatically:
- ✓ Creates infrastructure (database, schema, API integration, Git repo stage)
- ✓ Deploys all modules from the Git repository
- ✓ Validates the deployment
- ✓ Creates/resumes the dedicated demo warehouse `SFE_SAM_SNOWMAN_WH`

See `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

### Deployment Standard

- `deploy_all.sql` (repo root) is the canonical deployment artifact for all environments.
- Recommended flow: Copy/paste into Snowsight. CLI alternative: `snow sql -f deploy_all.sql` or `snowsql -f deploy_all.sql`.
- No wrapper scripts are required; keeping the solution all-SQL preserves portability and clarity.

## Components Created

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Agent | `SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.AGENTS.sam_the_snowman` | Orchestrates tools and answers questions |
| Agent Visibility | `SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_OBJECT_DEFAULT` | Controls agent visibility in Snowflake Intelligence UI |
| Semantic views | `SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE.SEMANTIC_MODELS.SV_SAM_*` | Domain datasets for performance, cost, and warehouse analytics |
| Email procedure | `SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE.INTEGRATIONS.sfe_send_email()` | Sends HTML mail via `SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL` |
| Git repository stage | `SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE.DEPLOY.SFE_SAM_THE_SNOWMAN_REPO` | Stores the Git clone used by `deploy_all.sql` |
| Demo warehouse | `SFE_SAM_SNOWMAN_WH` | X-Small warehouse auto-created/resumed for all demo workloads |
| Documentation database | `snowflake_documentation` | Supplies Cortex Search with official Snowflake guidance |

Schemas follow the demo pattern: `DEPLOY` (infrastructure), `INTEGRATIONS` (external systems), and `SEMANTIC_MODELS` (shared semantic views). All account-level objects use the `SFE_` prefix for easy discovery and cleanup. Semantic views use the `SV_SAM_` prefix for project identification.

## Security & Access

- Deployment scripts assume the **SYSADMIN** role for object ownership. If you require a different owner, edit the `USE ROLE SYSADMIN;` statements inside the SQL modules before deploying.
- No PUBLIC grants are created. Grant the owning role (default SYSADMIN) or additional roles as needed after deployment.
- The Snowpark email procedure uses parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.
- Semantic views read from `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE`; no write access is granted.
- The deployment auto-creates and uses `SFE_SAM_SNOWMAN_WH`; you can grant additional roles access or resize it as needed.

---

## Cleanup

Run the teardown script to remove demo objects while leaving shared databases in place:

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM '@SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE.deploy.SFE_SAM_THE_SNOWMAN_REPO/branches/main/sql/99_cleanup/teardown_all.sql';
```

The script drops the agent, semantic views, email procedure, and Git stage, but preserves `SNOWFLAKE_EXAMPLE` and `SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE` databases per demo standards.
