# =============================================================================
# MODULE CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS
# =============================================================================
module_custom_instructions:
  sql_generation: |-
    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. ALWAYS exclude system-managed warehouses: WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME NOT LIKE 'SYSTEM$%'
    2. When asked about "slow queries", use TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME (user-perceived latency)
    3. When asked about "execution time", use EXECUTION_TIME (actual processing)
    4. Time is in milliseconds - divide by 1000 for seconds, 60000 for minutes
    5. Use APPROX_PERCENTILE for percentile calculations, not PERCENTILE_CONT
    6. For "top N" or "worst N" queries, always include QUERY_ID and QUERY_TEXT

    DATA LATENCY:
    - ACCOUNT_USAGE data has ~45 minute latency
    - For real-time data, users should use INFORMATION_SCHEMA instead

    SPILLING INTERPRETATION:
    - Local spill: Minor issue, may benefit from larger warehouse
    - Remote spill: CRITICAL - significant performance impact, must address

  question_categorization: |-
    Treat these as UNAMBIGUOUS_SQL:
    - "slowest queries" - ORDER BY TOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME DESC
    - "most expensive queries" - ORDER BY CREDITS_ATTRIBUTED_COMPUTE DESC
    - "queries with errors" - WHERE EXECUTION_STATUS = 'FAIL'
    - "queries with spilling" - WHERE BYTES_SPILLED > 0

    Ask for clarification:
    - "performance issues" - too vague, ask what specific metric
